              > Hi there! I'm Miguel Rodriguez, a Rendering Engineer with around ~8 years of experience in the games industry.
			  <br><br> I studied Computer Science in my hometown in Spain. As I was wrapping up my time in college, I realized I wanted to specialize in game development, which led me to study C++, games and game engines on my spare time.
			  <br><br> After finishing my degree, I took a master's degree in videogame development and from there I moved to the UK to finally become a professional gamedev.
			  <br><br> I spent some years working at Ubisoft Reflections, firstly as a Junior and eventually as a Graphics Programmer. I worked on different AAA projects there, including Tom Clancy's The Division 2.
			  <br><br> After that, I moved to Striking Distance Studios, where I had the chance to work along industry legends like Jorge Jimenez and Glen Schofield. 
			  <br><br> In there, I was involved in some groundbreaking work pushing visual realism in The Callisto Protocol and I became a Senior Rendering Engineer along the way.
			  <br><br> Currently, I am part of PUBG Studios working on an unnanounced project.
			  <br><br> Other than that, I'm very passionate about videogames, game development and computer graphics in general.</span

					<br> After the original release, we had the chance to revisit The Callisto Protocol and prepare the ultimate console version with the release of the Playstation 5 Pro system.
					<br> The project was entirely managed and developed by our Rendering team, and we brought a new set of visual improvements and in-depth performance polishing to deliver the most solid version possible.
					<br> We were able to provide 3 PS5 Pro modes (All of them with the full Ray Tracing pack): a quality 8K @30FPS mode, a balanced 4K @40FPS mode, and a performance 4K @60FPS mode.
					<br> Some of my main contributions here were: Leading the GPU performance efforts (also coordinating the QA team to monitor performance issues), Visual Improvements + Optimizations in Volumetric Fog, modifications in several Post Process effects and their scheduling in the pipeline, 
					assisting with R&D of new features (like PSSR) and the implementation of an event-based system to tweak visual settings and dynamic resolution during cutscenes and camera cuts.

					<br> In this project, I was the main contributor for Rendering changes and I led the performance efforts for all target platforms.
					<br> The game was based in the Callisto Protocol codebase, so moving from a photoreal, high fidelity game to a fast-paced, stylized action game required a full overhaul of the rendering pipeline.
					<br> I customized GPU systems across the table with a focus on performance, from Lighting and Shadows to Post Processing effects, also assisting the content teams in optimizing stylized Materials, VFX, Scene geometry... etc. 
					<br> We shipped at native 4K + 120FPS in current gen consoles, while ensuring solid 60fps in a wide range of handheld devices.

					<br> As part of the Rendering team, we pushed the boundaries of high fidelity graphics and photorealism in several areas like Character Rendering, Lighting systems (using Hardware Ray Tracing) or custom technology for Gore and Creatures based on Practical effects.
					<br> Some of my main contributions in the project: Ray Tracing Transmission system, Physically Based Refractions, collaborated in the R&D efforts for the Callisto BRDF model, Dual Normal Shading, several modifications to Unreal Engine Shading Models, a lot of GPU performance work for consoles (both current gen and last gen) ... etc

					For anyone passionate about games' graphics, Digital Foundry's channel has been a go-to place for years.
					Being showcased as one of the games with <a href="https://youtu.be/vaday6e9kVI?si=H9rxzZo9dCHM0TVg" style="color:#ff7885;font-weight:bold;">best visuals of the year</a> by them is definitely a highlight of my career.
